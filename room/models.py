    # The __str__method in Django models is used to provide a human-readable string representation of the model instance. It is a special method in Python that is called when you try to convert an object to a string, such as when printing the object or using it in a template.
    # For example, if you have a `Transaction` model, the `__str__` method can be used to display the transaction details in a more user-friendly way, such as `"John Doe - Groceries - Bought milk"` instead of the default string representation, which might be something like `"<Transaction object (1)>"`.
